In this solution, I created a recursive method that is passed in the suffix that it is looking for and
the current path. After finding the files and subdirectories part of the path, I checked the files for
the match suffix and called the recursive method again with the other subdirectories. At the end,
I appended the matching files to an array and returned it.
