# Data-Structures
Using different data structures in a variety of problems:

### Problem 1: LRU Cache

Use a queue and a hash to implement a LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache.

### Problem 2: File Recursion

Find all the files under a directory with a specfic extension.

### Problem 3: Huffman Coding

Implement "Huffman Coding," a lossless data compression algorithm, using a hash, priority queue, tree, and recursion.

### Problem 4: Active Directory

Recursive lookup of whether a user is within a group.

### Problem 5: Blockchain

Linked list and hashing implementation of blockchains.

### Problem 6: Union and Intersection

Finding the unions and intersections of linked lists.

The problems were complated for Udacity's "Data Structures and Algorithms" course.
